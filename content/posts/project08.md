You might be intrigued, wondering why I made a grooming machine for Ring-tailed lemurs. This was a semester-long investigation I did during my “Interaction Design in the Wild” class co-taught by Parsons School of Design and San Diego Zoo.

<p class="caption">A project overview <b>demo video</b></p>

The goal was to research an animal and to create an intervention that would improve their welfare. Throughout my project process, I had back-and-forth conversations with lemur experts at the Duke Lemur Center, the San Diego Zoo, the Bronx Zoo to make sure my project was fitted, meaningful and not anthropocentric.

<p class="caption">Allo-grooming device component breakdown</b></p>
I created a series of objects that were meant for bettering Ring-tailed lemurs lives in a zoo setting. There was the modular foraging box that mimics their probing behavior in the wild, a play-tail that mirrors their chasing behavior, and eventually, an all-grooming device that’s designed for socially left-out Ring-tailed lemurs or other similar primate species that are isolated for hospitalization or in the transition to returning to their social group.

<p class="caption">Where the shape of the device came from</b></p>
Deriving from Ring-tailed Lemurs' natural features and grooming habits, the physiology and the functions of the device are unique to Ring-tailed Lemurs. The device has two main elements: a furry surface that produces lemur-like purring feedback and a hugging massage surface, which, in other words, is a reaction to being groomed by a male lemur and an affordance of grooming back the same lemur. 

The creation and iterations of this device are supported by scientific research in Ring-tailed Lemurs' social grooming behaviors as well as by Ring-tailed Lemurs caretakers and animal experts. The All-grooming device is a design solution to a real need that many lower-ranking male ring-tailed lemurs in their female-dominant social troops are facing in the wild or a captivated environment.
